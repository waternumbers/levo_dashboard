    <h1>Cookie Policy</h1>
    <h3>What is a Cookie?</h3>
    <p>A cookie is a small file of letters and numbers that we store on your browser or the hard drive of your computer if you agree. Cookies contain information that is transferred to your computer’s hard drive.</p>
    <p>Our website uses cookies to collect information about how you browse the site, remembering your preferences, the notifications you’ve seen so we don’t show them do you again, or what is in your shopping basket. This helps us to provide you with a good experience when you browse our website and also allows us to improve our site.</p>
    <p>We use the following cookies:</p>
    <h3>Our own cookies</h3>
    <p>We use cookies to make our website work including recording your agreement with our Privacy Policy, Cookie Policy and Disclaimer. There is no way to prevent these cookies being set other than not to use our site.</p>
    <h3>Third party functions</h3>
    <p>Our site, like most websites, includes functionality provided by third parties. A common example is the provision of secure registration or payment processing. Our site currently includes functionality from the following providers which use cookies:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>firebase - <a href="https://firebase.google.com/support/privacy/">Privacy Policy</a> - Provide user authentication and hosting</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Disabling these cookies will likely break the functions offered by these third parties</p>
    <h3>Visitor Statistics Cookies</h3>
    <p>We use cookies to compile visitor statistics such as how many people have visited our website, what type of technology they are using (e.g. Mac or Windows which helps to identify when our site isn’t working as it should for particular technologies), how long they spend on the site, what page they look at etc. This helps us to continuously improve our website. These so called “analytics” programs also tell us if how people reached this site (e.g. from a search engine) and whether they have been here before helping us to put more money into developing our services for you instead of marketing spend.</p>
    <h3>Turning cookies off</h3>
    <p>You can usually switch cookies off by adjusting your browser settings to stop it from accepting cookies. Doing so however will likely limit the functionality of ours and a large proportion of the world’s websites as cookies are a standard part of most modern websites</p>
    <p>It may be that your concerns around cookies relate to so called “spyware”. Rather than switching off cookies in your browser you may find that anti-spyware software achieves the same objective by automatically deleting cookies considered to be invasive. Please note that third parties (including, for example, advertising networks and providers of external services like web traffic analysis services) may also use cookies, over which we have no control. These cookies are likely to be analytical/performance cookies or targeting cookies.</p>
    <p>You can block cookies by activating the setting on your browser that allows you to refuse the setting of all or some cookies. However, if you use your browser settings to block all cookies (including essential cookies) you may not be able to access all or parts of our site.</p>
